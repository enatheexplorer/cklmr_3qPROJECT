Project Name: CEEKAYLAMAR FIGHT SIMULATOR

Description:
This project is a simple fight simulator game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can engage in virtual combat with an opponent, utilizing attacks and defenses to reduce their opponent's health to zero before theirs is depleted.


Game Instructions:
1. Upon loading the game, you'll see a header displaying the game name and a video background.
2. The player's and opponent's health statuses are displayed, each with two hearts representing their lives.
3. The attack and defend buttons are disabled at this moment because the game will only start once the coin toss happens. (Click on the "Toss a Coin!" button to start the game.) This will determine whether you'll attack or defend first.
4. Choose either "Head" or "Tail" from the dropdown menu and click "Submit."
5. Depending on the coin toss result and your choice, you'll be enabled to either attack or defend. If your choice matches the toss' result, you have the advantage to attack first. Otherwise, both attack and defend will be available for you.
6. Click the "Attack!" button to initiate an attack or the "Defend!" button to defend against your opponent's attack.
7. The game commentary section will display the outcome of each action, including damage dealt or blocked.
8. The game continues until either you or your opponent's health reaches zero. Once someone, either you or the opponent (bot) has a 0 life, a mesasge will display on the screen, announcing the winner.
9. Then, click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

Notes:
Attacks and defenses are randomized with calculated damage.
The game ends when one player's health reaches zero.
Enjoy the game and have fun!
You acn press the reset button anytime during the game.
